# Pentesting Methodology

## 0- Physical Attacks

Do you have **physical access** to the machine that you want to attack? You should read some **\*\*\[**tricks about physical attacks**\]\(physical-attacks/physical-attacks.md\) and others about \[**escaping from GUI applications\*\*\]\(physical-attacks/escaping-from-gui-applications/\).

## 1- [Discovering hosts inside the network ](pentesting/pentesting-network/#discovering-hosts)

## **2-** [**Having Fun with the network**](pentesting/pentesting-network/)

Before attacking a host maybe you prefer to **steal some credentials** **from the network** or **sniff** some **data** to learn **passively/actively\(MitM\)** what can you find inside the network. You can read [**Pentesting Network**](pentesting/pentesting-network/#sniffing).

## 3- [Port Scan - Service discovery](pentesting/pentesting-network/#scanning-hosts)

The first thing to do when **looking for vulnerabilities in a host** is to know which **services are running** in which ports. Let's see the[ **basic tools to scan ports of hosts**](pentesting/pentesting-network/#scanning-hosts).

## **4-** [Searching service version exploits](search-exploits.md)

Once you know which services are running, and maybe their version, you have to **search for known vulnerabilities**. Maybe you get lucky and there is a exploit to give you a shell...

## **5-** Pentesting Services

If there isn't any fancy exploit for any running service, you should look for **common misconfigurations in each service running.**

**Inside this book you will find a guide to pentest the most common services** \(and others that aren't so common\)**. Please, search in the left index the** _**PENTESTING**_ **section** \(the services are ordered by their default ports\).

**I want to make a special mention of the** [**Pentesting Web**](pentesting/pentesting-web/) **part \(as it is the most extensive one\).**  
Also, a small guide on how to[ **find known vulnerabilities in software**](search-exploits.md) can be found here.

**If your service is not inside the index, search in Google** for other tutorials and **let me know if you want me to add it.** If you **can't find anything** in Google, perform your **own blind pentesting**, you could start by **connecting to the service, fuzzing it and reading the responses** \(if any\).

### 5.1 Automatic Tools

There are also several tools that can perform **automatic vulnerabilities assessments**. **I would recommend you to try** [**Legion**](https://github.com/carlospolop/legion)**, which is the tool that I have created and it's based on the notes about pentesting services that you can find in this book.**

### **5.2 Brute-Forcing services**

In some scenarios a **Brute-Force** could be useful to **compromise** a **service**. [**Find here a CheatSheet of different services brute forcing**](brute-force.md)**.**

## **6-** [**Getting Shell**](shells/shells/)\*\*\*\*

Somehow you should have found **some way to execute code** in the victim. Then, [a list of possible tools inside the system that you can use to get a reverse shell would be very useful](shells/shells/).

Specially in Windows you could need some help to **avoid antiviruses**: **\*\*\[**Check this page**\]\(windows/av-bypass.md\)**.\*\*

## 7- Inside

If you have troubles with the shell, you can find here a small **compilation of the most useful commands** for pentesters:

* [**Linux**](linux-unix/useful-linux-commands/)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Windows \(CMD\)**](windows/basic-cmd-for-pentesters.md)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Winodows \(PS\)**](windows/basic-powershell-for-pentesters/)\*\*\*\*

## **8 -** [**Exfiltration**](exfiltration.md)\*\*\*\*

You will probably need to **extract some data from the victim** or even **introduce something** \(like privilege escalation scripts\). **Here you have a** [**post about common tools that you can use with these purposes**](exfiltration.md)**.**

## **9- Privilege Escalation**

### **9.1- Local Privesc**

If you are **not root/Administrator** inside the box, you should find a way to **escalate privileges.**  
Here you can find a **guide to escalate privileges locally in** [**Linux**](linux-unix/privilege-escalation/) **and in** [**Windows**](windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/)**.**  
You should also check this pages about how does **Windows work**:

* [**Authentication, Credentials, Token privileges and UAC**](windows/credentials.md)\*\*\*\*
* How does [**NTLM works**](windows/ntlm/)\*\*\*\*
* How to [**steal credentials**](windows/stealing-credentials/) in Windows
* Some tricks about [_**Active Directory**_](windows/active-directory-methodology/)_\*\*\*\*_

**Don't forget to checkout the best tools to enumerate Windows and Linux local Privilege Escalation paths:** [**Suite PEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)

### **9.2- Domain Privesc**

Here you can find a [**methodology explaining the most common actions to enumerate, escalate privileges and persist on an Active Directory**](windows/active-directory-methodology/). Even if this is just a subsection of a section, this process could be **extremely delicate** on a Pentesting/Red Team assignment.

## 10 - POST

### **10**.1 - Looting

Check if you can find more **passwords** inside the host or if you have **access to other machines** with the **privileges** of your **user**.  
Find here different ways to [**dump passwords in Windows**](windows/stealing-credentials/).

### 10.2 - Persistence

**Use 2 o 3 different types of persistence mechanism so you won't need to exploit the system again.  
Here you can find some** [**persistence tricks on active directory**](windows/active-directory-methodology/#persistence)**.**

TODO: Complete persistence Post in Wnidows & Linux

## 11 - Pivoting

With the **gathered credentials** you could have access to other machines, or maybe you need to **discover and scan new hosts** \(start the Pentesting Methodology again\) inside new networks where your victim is connected.  
In this case tunnelling could be necessary. Here you can find [**a post talking about tunnelling**](tunneling-and-port-forwarding.md).  
You definitely should also check the post about [Active Directory pentesting Methodology](windows/active-directory-methodology/). There you will find cool tricks to move laterally, escalate privileges and dump credentials.  
Check also the page about [**NTLM**](windows/ntlm/), it could be very useful to pivot on Windows environments..
